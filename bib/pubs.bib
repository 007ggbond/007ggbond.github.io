	abstract = {Based on the observation of overnight hair curling procedure, we establish a mechanical model to describe the temporary wave formation of straight hair (initial curvature is zero), which incorporates the contact between hair and hair roller. Systematic studies are carried out to explore the effects of radius ratio between hair and hair roller, hair’s average axial strain, creep time, Poisson’s ratio and gravity on the curl retention. The variation of curl retention with respect to time obtained from our numerical model is validated by a simple theoretical model and by overnight curling experiments on hair samples. The results of simulation show that overnight hair curling is suitable to create a wavy hairstyle within about 7 hours, while the combined usage with hair fixatives enables a wavy hairstyle with desired curvature that lasts for a day or more.

Here we investigate experimentally and theoretically the possibility of using graphene oxide (GO) as a flocculant to remove methylene blue (MB) from water. Experimental results show that GO can remove almost all MB from aqueous solutions at its optimal dosages and molecular dynamics simulations indicate that MB cations quickly congregate around GO in water. Furthermore, PIXEL energy contribution analysis reveals that most of the strong interactions between GO and MB are of a van der Waals (London dispersion) character. These results offer new insights for shedding light on the molecular mechanism of interaction between GO and organic pollutants.},

It is found that thermal conductivity has a remarkable size effect, because of the restricted paths for phonon transport, which is strongly dependent on the diameter and length of the nanotube. Owing to the intensified low-frequency phonons, axial tensile strain can facilitate thermal transport. In contrast, compressive strain weakens thermal transport due to the enhanced phonon scattering around the buckling of the nanotube. In addition, the thermal conductivity is dramatically reduced by single vacancies, particularly those with high defect concentrations.},

Herein, we report a recently discovered unconventional, reversible chemical reaction driven by water quantities in nanopores. The reduction of the number of water molecules present in the pore space promotes the hydrolysis of CO32− to HCO3− and OH−. This phenomenon led to a nano-structured CO2 sorbent that binds CO2 spontaneously in ambient air when the surrounding is dry, while releasing it when exposed to moisture. The underlying mechanism is elucidated theoretically by computational modeling and verified by experiments. The free energy of CO32− hydrolysis in nanopores reduces with a decrease of water availability. This promotes the formation of OH−, which has a high affinity to CO2. The effect is not limited to carbonate/bicarbonate, but is extendable to a series of ions. Humidity-driven sorption opens a new approach to gas separation technology.},

Several main characteristics discovered through theoretical/numerical studies are validated by proof-of-concept experiments using various types of leaves.

First, the adsorption of CH4 and CO2molecules on phosphorene sheet were conducted by DFT study. Then, adsorption performances of natural gas components as well as their binary CO2/CH4 gas mixture were investigated at 300 K with the pressure up to 3.0 MPa. The effects of slit pore width, H, and mole ratio of CO2/CH4in the gas phase on the separation of CO2 from mixtures of CO2/CH4 were also investigated. Our DFT calculation results show that the CO2 moleculehas higher adsorption energy than that of CH4, which implies that it can be easily adsorbed to the phosphorene surface than CH4. Detailed GCMC simulations reveal that the phosphorene slit pore has a high performance in separating CO2fromnature gas and achieves the highest gas selectivity at H = 1.0 nm at pressures lower than 0.1 MPa. Moreover, the selectivity of CO2 overCO2/CH4gas mixture increases with increasing the mole ratio of CO2/CH4due to the enhanced adsorbate-adsorbent interactions for the favorable component. Therefore, it is suggested that the phosphorene is a promising candidate for natural gas purification and possessing practical potential applications in gas adsorption.},

It was shown that two one-end-open CNTs with different diameters can coaxially self-assemble into a nanocapsule. The nanocapsules formed were stable in aqueous solution under ambient conditions, and the pressure inside the nanocapsule was much higher than the ambient pressure due to the van der Waals interactions between the two parts of the nanocapsule. The effects of the normalized radius difference, normalized inter-tube distance and aspect ratio of the CNT pairs were systematically explored. The electric field response of the nanocapsules was studied using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, which shows that the nanocapsules can be opened by applying an external electric field, due to the polarization of carbon atoms. This discovery not only sheds light on a simple yet robust nanocapsule self-assembly mechanism, but also underpins potential innovations in drug delivery, nano-reactors, etc.},

ReaxFF for P/H is transferable to a wide range of phosphorus- and hydrogen-containing systems including bulk black phosphorus, blue phosphorene, edge-hydrogenated phosphorene, phosphorus clusters, and phosphorus hydride molecules. The potential parameters were obtained by conducting global optimization with respect to a set of reference data generated by extensive ab initio calculations. We extended ReaxFF by adding a 60° correction term, which significantly improved the description of phosphorus clusters. Emphasis was placed on the mechanical response of black phosphorene with different types of defects. Compared to the nonreactive SW potential (Jiang, J.-W. Nanotechnology 2015, 26, 315706), ReaxFF for P/H systems provides a significant improvement in describing the mechanical properties of the pristine and defected black phosphorene, as well as the thermal stability of phosphorene nanotubes. A counterintuitive phenomenon is observed that single vacancies weaken the black phosphorene more than double vacancies with higher formation energy. Our results also showed that the mechanical response of black phosphorene is more sensitive to defects in the zigzag direction than that in the armchair direction. In addition, we developed a preliminary set of ReaxFF parameters for P/H/O/C to demonstrate that the ReaxFF parameters developed in this work could be generalized to oxidized phosphorene and P-containing 2D van der Waals heterostructures. That is, the proposed ReaxFF parameters for P/H systems establish a solid foundation for modeling of a wide range of P-containing materials.},

It is also found via ab initio calculations that the band structure along tube axis substantially changes with the structural transformation. The direct-to-indirect transition of band gap is highlighted when collapsing into the arc-like nanoribbons but not the sigmoidal ones.

However, the band gaps of most reported two-dimensional (2D) materials are smaller than 2.0 eV, which has greatly restricted their optoelectronic applications in the blue and ultraviolet range of the spectrum. Here, we propose a stable trisulfur dinitride (S3N2) 2D crystal that is a covalent network composed solely of S-N σ bonds. The S3N2 crystal is dynamically, thermally, and chemically stable, as confirmed by the computed phonon spectrum and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. GW calculations show that the S3N2 crystal is a wide, direct band-gap (3.92 eV) semiconductor with a small-hole effective mass. In addition, the band gap of S3N2 structures can be tuned by forming multilayer S3N2 crystals, S3N2 nanoribbons, and S3N2 nanotubes, expanding its potential applications. The anisotropic optical response of the 2D S3N2 crystal is revealed by GW–Bethe-Salpeter-equation calculations. The optical band gap of S3N2 is 2.73 eV and the exciton binding energy of S3N2 is 1.19 eV, showing a strong excitonic effect. Our result not only marks the prediction of a 2D crystal composed of nitrogen and sulfur, but also underpins potential innovations in 2D electronics and optoelectronics.},

	abstract = {Developing inexpensive and highly efficient CO2 air capture technologies is an important solution for solving the greenhouse problem. In this work, we used the low-cost quaternized chitosan (QCS)/poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hybrid aerogels with quaternary ammonium groups and hydroxide ions to reversibly capture CO2 from ambient air by humidity swing. The CO2 capture capacity and adsorption rate of the aerogels were investigated over the temperature range 10–30 °C. The CO2 capture capacity of the aerogels was measured to be about 0.18 mmol/g, which is 38\% higher than the state-of-the-art commercial membrane. In addition, we proposed a modified pseudo-first-order kinetic model considering both the CO2 adsorption and the H2O desorption, which describes the experimental results very well. For the first time, the moisture-swing CO2 adsorbent is built by low-cost biomass material, which opens up a new approach for the design of the moisture-swing CO2 adsorbent.},

	abstract = {The mechanical behaviors of monolayer black phosphorene (MBP) are explored by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using a reactive force field. It is revealed that the temperature and strain rate have a significant influence on the mechanical behavior of MBP, and they are further weakened by SW (Stone–Wales) defects. In general, the tensile strength for both the pristine and SW defective MBP decreases with the increase of temperature or decrease of strain rate. Surprisingly, for relatively high temperature ({\textgreater}300 K) and low strain rate ({\textless}5.0 × 10–8 fs–1), a phase transition from the black phosphorene to a mixture of β-phase (β-P) and γ-phase (γ-P) is observed for the SW-2 defective MBP under armchair tension, while self-healing of the SW-2 defect is observed under zigzag tension. A deformation map of SW-2 defective MBP under armchair tension at different temperature and strain rate is established, which is useful for the design of phosphorene allotropes by strain. The results presented herein yield useful insights for designing and tuning the structure, and the mechanical and physical properties of phosphorene.},

	abstract = {Bones have different functions and various applications depending on the roles they play in different mammal bodies. The internal relationships between the functions and microstructures of bones need further expounding to understand their specific mechanical properties. In this study, the relationships between the mechanical properties and microstructures of the compact bone of antler (called as antler bone for short) along its three different orientations are investigated. First, the bending mechanical properties of the specimens of the antler bone along its three different orientations are tested with material-testing machine, followed by the observations of the crack-extending routes and the fracture surfaces of the three different orientations with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results of the tests reveal that the antler bone possesses anisotropic mechanical property. Namely, the mechanical properties of the antler bone are closely related to its orientations. Concretely, the fracture strength, elastic modulus and work-of-fracture along the transversal orientation of the bone are remarkably larger than those of the longitudinal and radial orientations. The results of the observation of the SEM show that there are different crack-extending routes and fracture-surface characteristics along the three different fracture orientations of the bone. Specifically, there are crack deflections and crack twists along the transversal fracture orientation, crack bridging along the longitudinal fracture orientation and crack rounding of osteons along the radial fracture orientation. Based on the tested and observed results, the fractal models of the crack-extending routes along the three different fracture orientations are presented. The fractal dimensions and critical crack extension forces along the three different fracture directions are calculated based on the fractal models. Further, the box-counting method is adopted to verify the correctness of the models. It is indicated that the fractal dimension and fracture energy of the transversal orientation are obviously larger than those of the longitudinal and radial orientations, which are in accordance with the experimental results.},

We discuss the transformation mechanism in detail. More interestingly, the transformed samples in black can rapidly self-heal into yellow ones when exposed to deionized water (DI water). Contrary to other hybrid perovskites, DMASnI3 crystals exhibit excellent water phase stability. For example, DMASnI3 was immersed in DI water for 16 h and no decomposition was observed. Inspired by its excellent water phase stability, we demonstrate a potential eco-friendly application of DMASnI3 in photo-catalysis for H2 evolution in DI water. We present the first H2 evolution rate of 0.64 µmol h−1 with good recycling properties for pure DMASnI3 crystals. After the narrowing process, the optical band gap of DMASnI3 can be lowered from 2.48 eV to 1.32 eV. Systematical characterizations are applied to investigate their structures and optoelectronic properties. The reversible band gap narrowing behavior and outstanding electrical properties, such as higher carrier mobility and long carrier lifetime show that DMASnI3 has a great potential for optoelectronic applications.},

This paper presents a quantitative analysis, based on atomistic modeling, of the behavior of ions and the impact of hydration in a novel CO2 sorbent. We explore moisture-driven CO2 sorbents focusing on diffusion of ions and the structure of ion hydration complexes forming inside water-laden resin structures. We show that the stability of the carbonate ion is reduced as the water content of the resin is lowered. As the hydration cloud of the carbonate ion shrinks, it becomes energetically favorable to split a remaining water molecule and form a bicarbonate ion plus a hydroxide ion. These two ions bind less water than a single, doubly charged carbonate ion. As a result, under relatively dry conditions, more OH− ions are available to capture CO2 than in the presence of high humidity. Local concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon and water determine chemical equilibria. Reaction kinetics is then driven to a large extent by diffusion rates that allow water and anions to move through the resin structure. Understanding the basic mechanics of chemical equilibria and transport may help us to rationally design next-generation efficient moisture-driven CO2 sorbents.},

The morphological transition is different than those of defect-free substrates. Numerical simulations of continuously compressed bilayer with pre-patterned cavities are carried out to elucidate the transition mechanism of surface patterns. Parallel experiments of cavities-patterned bilayer prototypes by 3D-printing are also performed to validate the findings in simulations. A rich diversity of periodic surface topologies, including overall spreading waves, localizations, saw-like and co-existing features of folds and wrinkles can be obtained by varying the diameter, depth and spacing of cavities, which provides a potential approach to engineer various surface patterns for applications.},

For α-heart structure, general out-of-plane NPR exists under in-plane tension in y direction, while for β-heart type structures general NPR exists under in-plane tension in x direction. Through DFT calculations, we revealed that NPR is a general phenomenon for X3M2 with heart-shaped atomic structures, and the absolute value of out-of-plane NPR for X3M2 is always one order of magnitude larger than other 2-D crystals reported before. At the same time, in-plane NPR at certain angles around two in-plane principal axes also exists for X3M2 except S3P2 due to the special heart-shaped structure. Coexistence of out-of-plane and in-plane NPR for 2-D crystals has not been reported before and these significant three-dimensional (3-D) auxetic properties in 2-D crystals may enormously enrich the researches on novel mechanical, electrical and chemical behaviors of 2-D crystals.

	abstract = {This study elucidates a mechanism to improve fouling resistance for a polysulfone (PSf) membrane by blending polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). PSf is generally hydrophobic in nature and tends to be fouled by natural organic matter (NOM) due to a hydrophobic bonding during membrane ﬁltration. Thus, to reduce hydrophobic bonding, a hydrophilic treatment is conducted using non-solvent induced phase separation, in which PVP is added to the PSf membrane. To investigate the chemical properties of the membrane surface, a surface elemental analysis using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and contact angle measurement of water droplets is conducted. It is found that, with an increase in PVP additive, macroscopic hydrophilicity increases. Next, to measure the surface adsorption of hydrophobic bonding, atomic force microscopy (AFM) is used. In this study, the AFM probe tip is chemically modiﬁed with hydrophobic matter that mimics hydrophobic NOM. With this AFM tip, contact force measurements are conducted in order to measure the absorption characteristics between the membrane surface and the NOM. Furthermore, a cross-ﬂow ﬁltration test is carried out to measure adsorption amounts of tannic acid (as a model hydrophobic substance) into the PSf membrane. Finally, these experimental results were phenomenologically investigated using a molecular dynamics simulation to clarify the hydrophilicity mechanism and improvement of anti-fouling performance of the membrane.},
