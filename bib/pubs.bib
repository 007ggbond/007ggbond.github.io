	abstract = {Based on the observation of overnight hair curling procedure, we establish a mechanical model to describe the temporary wave formation of straight hair (initial curvature is zero), which incorporates the contact between hair and hair roller. Systematic studies are carried out to explore the effects of radius ratio between hair and hair roller, hair’s average axial strain, creep time, Poisson’s ratio and gravity on the curl retention. The variation of curl retention with respect to time obtained from our numerical model is validated by a simple theoretical model and by overnight curling experiments on hair samples. The results of simulation show that overnight hair curling is suitable to create a wavy hairstyle within about 7 hours, while the combined usage with hair fixatives enables a wavy hairstyle with desired curvature that lasts for a day or more.

	abstract = {Based on the observation of the natural senescence and experiment of the drying process of leaves, we establish phenomenological buckling models to explain the curled configuration of dried leaves, where the driving force is the differential contraction strain field. In the minimalist model, through a systematic study, the averaged buckling curvature is correlated with the aspect ratio and normalized size of the leaf, as well as the magnitude of the differential strain. In the refined model, the role of the vascular system is emphasized. Several main characteristics discovered through theoretical/numerical studies are validated by proof-of-concept experiments using various types of leaves. The findings in this paper not only shed some light on the intriguing natural phenomena, but also may enable potential applications in three-dimensional fabrications using mechanical self-assembly.},

	abstract = {We developed ReaxFF parameters for phosphorus and hydrogen to give a good description of the chemical and mechanical properties of pristine and defected black phosphorene. ReaxFF for P/H is transferable to a wide range of phosphorus- and hydrogen-containing systems including bulk black phosphorus, blue phosphorene, edge-hydrogenated phosphorene, phosphorus clusters, and phosphorus hydride molecules. The potential parameters were obtained by conducting global optimization with respect to a set of reference data generated by extensive ab initio calculations. We extended ReaxFF by adding a 60° correction term, which significantly improved the description of phosphorus clusters. Emphasis was placed on the mechanical response of black phosphorene with different types of defects. Compared to the nonreactive SW potential (Jiang, J.-W. Nanotechnology 2015, 26, 315706), ReaxFF for P/H systems provides a significant improvement in describing the mechanical properties of the pristine and defected black phosphorene, as well as the thermal stability of phosphorene nanotubes. A counterintuitive phenomenon is observed that single vacancies weaken the black phosphorene more than double vacancies with higher formation energy. Our results also showed that the mechanical response of black phosphorene is more sensitive to defects in the zigzag direction than that in the armchair direction. In addition, we developed a preliminary set of ReaxFF parameters for P/H/O/C to demonstrate that the ReaxFF parameters developed in this work could be generalized to oxidized phosphorene and P-containing 2D van der Waals heterostructures. That is, the proposed ReaxFF parameters for P/H systems establish a solid foundation for modeling of a wide range of P-containing materials.},

	abstract = {Two-dimensional materials have attracted tremendous attention for their fascinating electronic, optical, chemical, and mechanical properties. However, the band gaps of most reported two-dimensional (2D) materials are smaller than 2.0 eV, which has greatly restricted their optoelectronic applications in the blue and ultraviolet range of the spectrum. Here, we propose a stable trisulfur dinitride (S3N2) 2D crystal that is a covalent network composed solely of S-N σ bonds. The S3N2 crystal is dynamically, thermally, and chemically stable, as confirmed by the computed phonon spectrum and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. GW calculations show that the S3N2 crystal is a wide, direct band-gap (3.92 eV) semiconductor with a small-hole effective mass. In addition, the band gap of S3N2 structures can be tuned by forming multilayer S3N2 crystals, S3N2 nanoribbons, and S3N2 nanotubes, expanding its potential applications. The anisotropic optical response of the 2D S3N2 crystal is revealed by GW–Bethe-Salpeter-equation calculations. The optical band gap of S3N2 is 2.73 eV and the exciton binding energy of S3N2 is 1.19 eV, showing a strong excitonic effect. Our result not only marks the prediction of a 2D crystal composed of nitrogen and sulfur, but also underpins potential innovations in 2D electronics and optoelectronics.},

	abstract = {Reversible CO2 capture from ambient air by a humidity swing has shown great potential in mitigating the greenhouse effect. In this work, we developed a new humidity-swing absorbent based on PO43–/HPO42–/H2PO4– ions exhibiting superior CO2 absorption capacity and kinetics compared to that of CO32–/HCO3–-based absorbent. After ion exchange with PO43– ions, the ion-exchange resin (IER-PO4) containing positive quaternary ammonium groups and movable PO43– ions is able to reversibly capture CO2 from the ambient air by a humidity swing, which triggers the transformation between the PO43– ions and HPO42–/H2PO4– ions in the resin. In a dry environment, PO43– ions in IER-PO4 are hydrolyzed into OH– ions and HPO42– ions, which are further hydrolyzed into H2PO4– ions and OH– ions. Both hydrolysis reactions produce OH– ions for CO2 absorption, while the adsorbed CO2 can be released in a humid environment. The results of quantum chemical calculation show that the hydrolysis of the ions is promoted by the reduction of water molecules in the nanoscale hydrated cluster. The adsorption capacity of IER-PO4 during the moisture swing is 80\% larger than that of IER-CO3, and the adsorption rate of the IER-PO4 resin at a temperature range of 15–35 °C is much higher than that of the IER-CO3 absorbent. A modified pseudo-first-order (MPFO) kinetic is developed, which can describe the experimental results well. The present study sheds light on the design of high performance moisture-swing absorbents with PO43– ions.},

Here we report an effective method for splitting O2-containing CO2 into CO, through a chemical looping scheme with Cu (5 at\%) doped LaFeO3 perovskites as efficient oxygen carriers. Up to 2.28 mol/kg CO yield was achieved with high stability in the presence of O2, five times higher than that with the state-of-the-art oxygen carrier, while pristine LaFeO3 perovskite only showed efficient capability of reducing pure CO2. Furthermore, the syngas productivity was doubled with Cu modification. Through experimental characterizations and ab initio calculations, we uncovered that the exsolution of metallic Cu on the surface of reduced perovskite was able to mitigate the competition between CO2 and O2 in the re-oxidation step. We envision that the efficient CO2 splitter with well-designed oxygen carriers have the potential to facilitate economical combination of impure carbon feedstock and carbon utilization system.},

It is found the GBs are significantly disturbed for a weak surface disturbance with a bulge height of only 3.4 Å. The distance between GBs and the bulge plays an important role in determining the morphologies of GBs, and the aperiodic and curved GBs can be observed, which is attributed to several representative structures, like 5–6{\textbar}6–7 and 5–6–7 defects and GB deflection. In general, there are four fracture modes for GBs with weak surface disturbance depending on the existence of 5–6–7 and 5–6{\textbar}6–7 defects. While for a strong surface disturbance with a bulge height of 10 Å, the interaction between topological defects at bulged graphene and GBs will locally offset nearby 5–7 dislocation pairs, and there are two fracture modes depending on the structural integrality of GBs. Besides, it is also found that the aperiodic and curved morphologies of GBs widely exist for other orientation angles with surface disturbance. The results presented herein explore the mechanism for the interaction of GBs with surface disturbance during CVD growth and may provide some useful insights for designing and regulating the morphologies of GBs.},

	abstract = {The phase transition of monolayer black phosphorene (MBP, α-P) to β-P and γ-P is explored by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using reactive force fields. It is found that MBP can convert to a mixed phase of β-P and γ-P under biaxial strain, while the Stone–Wales defect (SW-2) in MBP can serve as an excellent ‘phase transition catalyzer’, significantly decreasing the critical strain for phase transition and increasing the homogeneity of the phase transition. The biaxial strain state (i.e. the strain components in the armchair and zigzag direction) and loading mode (i.e. the proportional and staged loading) have significant effects on the phase transition of MBP. In general, the phase transition of MBP is driven by the tension strain in the armchair direction, but large tension or compression strain in the zigzag direction can also promote the phase transition. Besides, MBP has a larger fracture strain under staged loading, generating a more uniform phase transition structure. The effects of curvature and SW-2 defect concentration on the phase transition of MBP are also studied, which shows an easier phase transition for a larger curvature and higher SW-2 defect concentration. The systematic results presented herein provide useful insights for designing and tuning the structure of MBP through phase transition facilitated by strain and defect engineering.},

	abstract = {The self-assembly mechanism of one-end-open carbon nanotubes (CNTs) suspended in an aqueous solution was studied by molecular dynamics simulations. It was shown that two one-end-open CNTs with different diameters can coaxially self-assemble into a nanocapsule. The nanocapsules formed were stable in aqueous solution under ambient conditions, and the pressure inside the nanocapsule was much higher than the ambient pressure due to the van der Waals interactions between the two parts of the nanocapsule. The effects of the normalized radius difference, normalized inter-tube distance and aspect ratio of the CNT pairs were systematically explored. The electric field response of the nanocapsules was studied using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, which shows that the nanocapsules can be opened by applying an external electric field, due to the polarization of carbon atoms. This discovery not only sheds light on a simple yet robust nanocapsule self-assembly mechanism, but also underpins potential innovations in drug delivery, nano-reactors, etc.},

	abstract = {Wrinkle formation followed by sharp strain localization is commonly observed in compressed stiff film/soft substrate systems. However, cavities or defects beneath the film may directly trigger the formation of local ridges and then folding configurations at a relatively small compressive strain, and a mixture of wrinkles and folds upon further compression. The morphological transition is different than those of defect-free substrates. Numerical simulations of continuously compressed bilayer with pre-patterned cavities are carried out to elucidate the transition mechanism of surface patterns. Parallel experiments of cavities-patterned bilayer prototypes by 3D-printing are also performed to validate the findings in simulations. A rich diversity of periodic surface topologies, including overall spreading waves, localizations, saw-like and co-existing features of folds and wrinkles can be obtained by varying the diameter, depth and spacing of cavities, which provides a potential approach to engineer various surface patterns for applications.},

	abstract = {The study of the gating mechanism of mechanosensitive channels opens a window to the exploration of how different mechanical stimuli induce adaptive cellular behaviors of both the protein and the lipid, across different time and length scales. In this work, through a molecular dynamics-decorated finite element method (MDeFEM), the gating behavior of mechanosensitive channels of small conductance (MscS) in Escherichia coli (E. coli) is studied upon membrane stretch or global bending. The local membrane curvature around MscS is incorporated, as well as multiple MscL (mechanosensitive channels of large conductance) molecules in proximity to MscS. The local membrane curvature is found to delay MscS opening and diminishes moderately upon membrane stretching. Mimicking the insertion of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) molecules into the lipid, both downward and upward bending can active MscS, as long as the global membrane curvature radius reaches 34 nm. Based on the different MscS pore evolutions observed with the presence of one or more MscLs nearby, we propose that when coreconstituted, multiple MscL molecules tend to be located at the local membrane curvature zone around MscS. In another word, as MscL “swims around” in the lipid bilayer, it can be trapped by the membrane's local curvature. Collectively, the current study provides valuable insights into the interplay between mechanosensitive channels and lipid membrane at structural and physical levels, and specific predictions are proposed for further experimental investigations.},

	abstract = {The study of soft deployable structures is an emergent field that is highly correlated with metamaterial design, soft robotics, medical devices, etc. This paper studies a novel two-dimensional (2D) soft deployable structure that has a fractal layout with hierarchically coupled thin walls, which buckles upon actuation and deforms into a “peacock tail” pattern that is over 10 fold its original dimension. Large deflection theory and finite-element (FE) modeling are used to characterize its mechanical performance and to investigate its potential application in multiple fields. Further, 2D FE homogenization is implemented to extend the novel design into an active plane lattice metamaterial, on which parametric studies are carried out to explore its effective stiffness and large strain properties. The results show that, besides excellent deformability, the “peacock tail” soft deployable structure and its lattice metamaterial derivates exhibit intriguing properties such as multi-stiffening, strong anisotropy, zero/negative Poisson's ratio, a unique post-buckling collapse mechanism, etc. Three-dimensional generalization of the fractal compliant system is modeled to elaborate on the practical use of the structures. This paper aims to enrich the spectrum of soft deployable structures, shedding light on the research of novel soft robots, hierarchical structures, and metamaterials.},

In this work, guanidine–H2O reactions with n = 1–8 water molecules were systematically studied by ab initio methods. The result suggests that the reduced availability of water molecules greatly inhibits the strong base guanidine from producing OH−. That is, guanidine exhibits the behavior of a weak bases in low-humidity nanoscale environments. Intriguingly, this effect is not limited to guanidine but could be applied to other strong bases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the direction of guanidine–CO2 reactions can be controlled by changing the number of water molecules present, which in turn responds to the humidity change in air. These findings not only shed some light on unconventional chemical reactions of strong bases in atmospheric clusters and on solid porous surfaces, but also provide insights into the development of guanidine-based CO2 air-capture sorbents.},

Blockchain platforms consume vast amounts of electricity based on the current consensus mechanism of Proof-of-Work (PoW). Here, we point out a different consensus mechanism named Proof-of-Stake (PoS) that can eliminate the extensive energy consumption of the current PoW-based blockchain. We comprehensively elucidate the current and projected energy consumption and carbon footprint of the PoW- and PoS-based Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchain platforms. The model of energy consumption of PoS-based Ethereum blockchain can lead the way toward the prediction of other PoS-based blockchain technologies in the future. With the widespread adoption of blockchain technology, if the current PoW mechanism continues to be employed, the carbon footprint of Bitcoin and Ethereum will push the global temperature above 1.5 °C in this century. However, a PoS-based blockchain can reduce the carbon footprint by 99\% compared to the PoW mechanism. The small amount of carbon footprint from PoS-based blockchain could make blockchain an attractive technology in a carbon-constrained future. The study sheds light on the urgency of developing the PoS mechanism to solve the current sustainability problem of blockchain.},
